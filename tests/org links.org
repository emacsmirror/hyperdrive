* Org link tests

/This subtree helps us understand and test the different kinds of Org links and whether and how they should work in various contexts./

+ *Notes*
  + This file should be loaded from a hyperdrive in order to verify that these links work correctly for an Org file loaded from a hyperdrive.
  + To decode these links with Org, use ~(org-element-context)~ with point on the link.  The resulting element/plist is used in function ~hyperdrive--org-open-at-point~.

** Link types

Here are various link types which we want to test.

*** DONE ~hyper://~-prefixed, with or without brackets
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from              [2023-09-06 Wed 18:23]
:END:

+ *Notes:*

  + Spaces and such should be URL-encoded :: We decline to automatically convert, e.g. spaces to ~%20~ when opening links; they should already be encoded.
    + [ ] Consider giving an error when unencoded e.g. spaces are detected.

**** DONE Links without targets
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2023-09-06 Wed 17:44]
- State "TODO"       from              [2023-08-30 Wed 14:43]
:END:

+ [[hyper://PUBLIC_KEY/links%20test.org]]
+ hyper://PUBLIC_KEY/links%20test.org

+ [2023-08-30 Wed 14:43] Getting this error (with the public key changed to the real one), for both the bracketed and unbracketed links: ~Hyperdrive: Generic hyper-gateway status 500 error. Is this URL correct? hyper:////wnqpdr9xdy1p9wofqbj7e7csueg7aynqbot8gt53ueunezry6any/links%20test.org~

  + There are FOUR SLASHES.
    
**** DONE Links with targets
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from              [2023-09-06 Wed 17:44]
:END:

*NOTE:* While in Org mode, these anchored links can only point to headings with matching ~CUSTOM_ID~ properties, in hyperdrive we first check for matching ~CUSTOM_ID~, then ~ID~, then exact heading title content matches.  (The anchor part is URL-decoded and the leading ~#~ is discarded.)

+ [[hyper://PUBLIC_KEY/links%20test.org#Heading%20A]]
+ hyper://PUBLIC_KEY/links%20test.org#Heading%20A

+ There are FOUR SLASHES.

*** Non-~hyper://~-prefixed links (inside brackets)

+ *Notes:*

  + Spaces and such are required to NOT be encoded :: Spaces in bracketed, Org-style links must /not/ have spaces, etc. URL-encoded.
    + We do this so that existing repositories of Org files can be mirrored to a hyperdrive as-is and the relative links between them will still work.

**** Links without targets

/Link to a file, without specifying a heading within it./

***** Links to hyperdrive files

/Note the lack of ~file:~ prefix, which would indicate a link to a local file./

+ [[./links test.org]]
+ [[/links test.org]] :: For non-hyperdrive files, this actually links to a file in the root directory of the filesystem.  For hyperdrives, we want this to point to a file in the hyperdrive's root.

****** CANCELED Fix functionality for links like ~[[links test.org]]~
:LOGBOOK:
- State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2023-09-06 Wed 18:00]
- State "TODO"       from              [2023-08-29 Tue 16:40]
:END:

NOTE: This is technically the same as [[id:c9711207-4a46-45be-9d67-3dc560249a5b][this link type]].

Org doesn't support this for local files (this syntax would point to a heading by that name), so we should follow Org here.  This is actually a bug.

***** Links to local files

/The ~file:~ prefix indicates that the link points to a local file (not one on a hyperdrive relative to the current hyperdrive file)/.

+ [[file:./links test.org]]
+ [[file:links test.org]]

**** Links with targets

/Links to headings within a file, rather than links to the file./

***** ~*~-prefixed heading names
:LOGBOOK:

/Links to headings within the file containing the link.  The filename is not specified./

+ [[*Heading A]]
  + Does not work, includes target part in URL sent to server.

****** TODO Specified file
:LOGBOOK:

:END:

/Links to headings in a specified file, potentially a different one./

+ [[./links test.org::*Heading A]]
+ [[/links test.org::*Heading A]]

+ These both go to the file but not the heading.

***** Unprefixed heading names

/Without a ~*~ or ~./~, the link is intended to point to a heading within the same document./
