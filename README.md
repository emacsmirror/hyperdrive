# hyperdrive.el - P2P filesystem in Emacs

[Hyperdrive](https://docs.holepunch.to/building-blocks/hyperdrive) is a secure, P2P, real-time, local-first, versioned
filesystem designed for easy peer-to-peer file sharing.
`hyperdrive.el` is an independent project built by [USHIN](https://ushin.org) which
provides an Emacs interface for managing hyperdrives.


## Installation

`hyperdrive.el` requires [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) version 27.1 or later.

`hyperdrive.el` is available on
[MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started). Once you've set up
MELPA, run `M-x package-install` then enter `hyperdrive`.


### `hyper-gateway`

`hyperdrive.el` relies on [hyper-gateway](https://github.com/RangerMauve/hyper-gateway/) for connecting to the P2P network ([installation instructions](https://github.com/RangerMauve/hyper-gateway#how-do-i-install-hyper-gateway)).
