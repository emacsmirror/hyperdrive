;;; Commentary:

;; Hyperdrive is a P2P, real-time, local-first, versioned filesystem
;; designed for easy peer-to-peer file sharing.  hyperdrive.el is an
;; independent project built by https://ushin.org, which provides an
;; Emacs interface for managing hyperdrives.

;;;; Installation:

;; hyperdrive.el requires Emacs version 28.1 or later.

;; hyperdrive.el is available on MELPA:
;; https://melpa.org/#/getting-started

;; Once you've set up MELPA, run
;; M-x package-install RET hyperdrive RET

;; hyperdrive.el relies on hyper-gateway-ushin for connecting to the P2P network:
;; https://git.sr.ht/~ushin/hyper-gateway-ushin

;; Installation instructions:
;; https://git.sr.ht/~ushin/hyper-gateway-ushin/#installation

;;; Code:

;;;; Requirements

(require 'cl-lib)

(require 'bookmark)
(require 'json)
(require 'rx)

;; NOTE: On older versions of Emacs with older built-in versions of
;; `map', it's not possible to force Emacs to load the newer version
;; of the library when compiling the package; we can only
;; "Package-Requires" it to cause it to be installed.  So in the case
;; that a user encounters an error caused by macro-expanding an older
;; version of the library, the user would need to delete the
;; hyperdrive package, restart Emacs, and reinstall this package to
;; fix it.
