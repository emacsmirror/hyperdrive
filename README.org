* hyperdrive.el - P2P filesystem in Emacs

[[https://docs.holepunch.to/building-blocks/hyperdrive][Hyperdrive]] is a secure, P2P, real-time, local-first, versioned
filesystem designed for easy peer-to-peer file sharing.
`hyperdrive.el` is an independent project built by [[https://ushin.org][USHIN]] which
provides an Emacs interface for managing hyperdrives.

** Installation

`hyperdrive.el` is available on [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA]]. Once you've set up MELPA, you
can run `M-x package-install` then enter `hyperdrive`.

*** `hyper-gateway`

`hyperdrive.el` relies on [[https://github.com/RangerMauve/hyper-gateway/][hyper-gateway]] for talking to the hypercore
network ([[https://github.com/RangerMauve/hyper-gateway#how-do-i-install-hyper-gateway)][installation instructions]]).
