All notable changes to [[https://ushin.org/hyperdrive/hyperdrive-manual.html][hyperdrive.el]] will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [[https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html][Semantic Versioning]].

* 0.4-pre

Version ~0.4~ features [[https://ushin.org/hyperdrive/hyperdrive-manual.html#Org_002dtransclusion-integration][org-transclusion integration]], easy gateway
installation with ~M-x hyperdrive-install~, and a faster directory UI!

** Security

- By default, don't automatically load major mode when browsing
  hyperdrive files.  To enable this behavior for certain trusted
  hyperdrives, see user option ~h/safe-hyperdrives~.

** Added

- Easy installation: After ~M-x package-install hyperdrive.el~, run ~M-x
  hyperdrive-install~ to install the gateway.
- Cancel installation in progress with ~hyperdrive-cancel-install~.
- Add ~hyperdrive-install~ and ~hyperdrive-cancel-install~ bindings to
  ~hyperdrive-menu~ and menu bar.
- Add ~hyperdrive-restart~ to restart the gateway, also bound in
  ~hyperdrive-menu~ and menu bar.
- When visiting an old version of a hyperdrive file, press ~n~ and ~p~ to
  traverse the version history.  Press ~q~ to kill the current buffer.

** Changed

- Switch from `hyper-gateway` to `hyper-gateway-ushin` fork!  Run ~M-x
  hyperdrive-install~ to download and install the new gateway.
- Directory listings load faster
- Improve gateway status indicators in ~hyperdrive-menu~ to update
  asynchronously with "starting", "installing", "upgrading", etc.
- Improve messages and errors when starting and stopping gateway.
- Remove gateway status indicator in hyperdrive menu bar since menu
  bar labels cannot be updated while the menu bar is open.
- Better error message when the gateway is not installed.
  Thanks to ~magnum~ on XMPP for reporting.
- Remove ~hyperdrive-reuse-buffers~ user option to ensure consistent
  behavior when uniquifying buffer names.
- Remove ~hyperdrive-gateway-process-type~ user option. To customize
  gateway startup, see options ~hyperdrive-gateway-start-function~,
  ~hyperdrive-gateway-stop-function~, ~hyperdrive-gateway-live-predicate~.
- Remove ~hyperdrive-gateway-command~ user option. To customize gateway
  command, see options ~hyperdrive-gateway-directory~,
  ~hyperdrive-gateway-program~, ~hyperdrive-gateway-command-args~.
- Rename and alias ~hyperdrive-hyper-gateway-ushin-port~ to
  ~hyperdrive-gateway-port~.  Alias will be removed in a later version.
- Improve defcustom types

** Fixed

- Fixed link targets/fragments for non-Org documents, like HTML.
- More reliably kill intermediate buffers when generating a diff.
- Avoid unnecessarily updating ~hyperdrive-version-ranges~.
- Include the first file in a directory as an ~imenu~ candidate.
- Start gateway subprocess on ~hyperdrive-gateway-port~.

** Internal

- Bumped package dependencies
- Refactor to accommodate [[https://ushin.org/hyperdrive/hyperdrive-manual.html#Org_002dtransclusion-integration][hyperdrive-org-transclusion]]
