# All notable changes to [[https://ushin.org/hyperdrive/hyperdrive-manual.html][hyperdrive.el]] will be documented in this file.
# This project adheres to [[https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html][Semantic Versioning]].

* 0.5.1-pre

** Fixed

- Fix equality predicate in ~hyperdrive-history-get~.  This fix means
  that loading an old version of a file after viewing that file's
  history will be much faster.  Thanks to Jonas Bernoulli for the fix!
- Fix ~hyperdrive-sbb-view-layout~ custom type.  Thanks again, Jonas!

* 0.5 [2024-12-06 Fri]

Version ~0.5~ adds the peer graph/list, adds a global hyperdrive context
menu, and simplifies the internal logic for getting file history.

** Added

- Add peer graph and peer list for discovering sources of information
  and exploring the connections between peers.
- Enable ~hyperdrive-context-menu-mode~ to enable right-click menus on
  on hyperdrive names.

** Changed

- It's now possible to attempt to jump to the next version of a file
  even before the gateway knows if it exists or not.
- More descriptive error messages when attempting to load nonexistent
  or unknown file versions.
- Removed persist variable ~hyperdrive-version-ranges~.  Feel free to
  delete the old data inside ~hyperdrive-persist-location~.
- Link website, library source, and Info manual in Customize group.
- More colorful version descriptions in ~hyperdrive-menu~.
- Hyperdrive nickname metadata are now loaded when opening any file,
  not just directories.
- ~hyperdrive-read-hyperdrive~ now parses the hyperdrive from a URL or
  public key and returns it.
- ~hyperdrive-nickname~ face now inherits from ~shadow~ to show its
  relative lack of trustworthiness compared to ~hyperdrive-petname~.

** Fixed

- Handle diffing a file when the previous version is not known to exist.
- ~hyperdrive-menu~ and the menu bar now correctly indicate when the
  next and/or previous version of current directory do not exist.
- Correctly jump to headings when following Org links to a hyperdrive
  file whose buffer is already open in a window.
- Only mark deleted hyperdrive file buffer as modified if it's live.
- ~hyperdrive-ewoc-next~ now correctly handles empty directories.

** Internal

- ~hyper-gateway-ushin~ can now directly control the hyperbee, so
  key/value (like peer graph data) can now be stored efficiently.
- ~hyper-gateway-ushin~ now has a ~/$/history~ API which can be
  queried to get the file history for a particular file.
- Add ~hyperdrive-fully-replicate~ to fully replicate a hyperdrive's
  inode db, blob store, or both.
- ~hyperdrive-fill-metadata~ can now optionally be called
  asynchronously.
- Bump package dependencies.

* 0.4.2 [2024-09-24 Tue]

** Fixed

- Set major mode in hyperdrive files even before it is saved.
- Compiler warnings.  (Thanks to Jonas Bernoulli!)

* 0.4.1 [2024-09-13 Fri]

** Fixed

- Fix following a link to an Org document whose target is not found.

* 0.4 [2024-09-09 Mon]

Version ~0.4~ features [[https://ushin.org/hyperdrive/hyperdrive-manual.html#Org_002dtransclusion-integration][org-transclusion integration]], easy gateway
installation with ~M-x hyperdrive-install~, and a command to save disk
space by "forgetting" your copy of a file (~hyperdrive-forget-file~)!

** Security

- By default, don't automatically load major mode when browsing
  hyperdrive files.  To enable this behavior for certain trusted
  hyperdrives, mark them as "safe" with ~M-x hyperdrive-mark-as-safe~,
  which is also bound in ~hyperdrive-menu~ and the hyperdrive menu bar.

** Added

- Easy installation: After ~M-x package-install hyperdrive.el~, run ~M-x
  hyperdrive-install~ to install the gateway.
- Cancel installation in progress with ~hyperdrive-cancel-install~.
- Add ~hyperdrive-install~ and ~hyperdrive-cancel-install~ bindings to
  ~hyperdrive-menu~ and menu bar.
- Add ~hyperdrive-restart~ to restart the gateway, also bound in
  ~hyperdrive-menu~ and menu bar.
- When visiting an old version of a hyperdrive file, press ~n~ and ~p~ to
  traverse the version history.  Press ~q~ to kill the current buffer.
- View hyperdrive disk usage with ~hyperdrive-describe~ and ~hyperdrive-menu~.
- Delete the local copy of a file or directory with
  ~hyperdrive-forget-file~, also bound in ~hyperdrive-menu~ and the
  menu bar, as well as directory and history buffers.
- Indicate how much of a file has already been downloaded based on the
  color of its file size in the directory view.

** Changed

- Switch from ~hyper-gateway~ to ~hyper-gateway-ushin~ fork!  Run ~M-x
  hyperdrive-install~ to download and install the new gateway.
- Directory listings load faster.
- Make ~hyperdrive-stop~ asynchronous by default.
- Improve gateway status indicators in ~hyperdrive-menu~ to update
  asynchronously with "starting", "installing", "upgrading", etc.
- Improve messages and errors when starting and stopping gateway.
- Remove gateway status indicator in hyperdrive menu bar since menu
  bar labels cannot be updated while the menu bar is open.
- Improve error message when the gateway is not installed.
  Thanks to ~magnum~ on XMPP for reporting.
- Make ~hyperdrive-download~ asynchronous.
- Remove ~hyperdrive-reuse-buffers~ user option to ensure consistent
  behavior when uniquifying buffer names.
- Embark map now has a binding for ~hyperdrive-describe-hyperdrive~.
- Remove ~hyperdrive-honor-auto-mode-alist~ user option; hyperdrives
  marked as ~safe~ now always enable a major mode.
- Remove ~hyperdrive-gateway-process-type~ user option. To customize
  gateway startup, see options ~hyperdrive-gateway-start-function~,
  ~hyperdrive-gateway-stop-function~, ~hyperdrive-gateway-live-predicate~.
- Remove ~hyperdrive-gateway-command~ user option. To customize gateway
  command, see options ~hyperdrive-gateway-directory~,
  ~hyperdrive-gateway-program~, ~hyperdrive-gateway-command-args~.
- Rename and alias ~hyperdrive-hyper-gateway-ushin-port~ to
  ~hyperdrive-gateway-port~.  Alias will be removed in a later version.
- Improve defcustom types

- Following explicit ~file:~-prefixed links in hyperdrive Org files now
  opens hyperdrive files in the same hyperdrive.
- Fix edge cases when loading version history for nonexistent entries.

- Improve visible buttons in ~hyperdrive-menu-bar-mode~.
